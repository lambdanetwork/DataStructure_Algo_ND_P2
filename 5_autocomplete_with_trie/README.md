## Create A Trie
- I am not familiar with python notebook, and the notebook way of testing it
- So I decide to create python file and create UnitTesting
- Kindly ignore the ipynb file, The file is included in boilerplate for this project
- I decide to use dictionary as it's printable and easy to check when traversing recursively
